## Directions

Use your knowledge of html, flexboxes, DOM and event listeners to complete the following design tasks. It may help to do a sketch of your desired layout before you begin coding!

Here are URL's for random photographs to use:
Square Photos - https://picsum.photos/200
Feed Photos - https://picsum.photos/400/500

### Landing Page

The landing page should have a pseudo log in form.

### Feed Page

The feed page has a top and bottom navigation bar, along with an indefinite feed of images/videos with their usernames and captions.

### Account Page

The account page lays out the images in a wrapped row as opposed to a column. Along with a nav bar and User information in the header. That account page should show up when a user's name or profile image is clicked. For now, the content for this page should just be the same, regardless of who was clicked on.
